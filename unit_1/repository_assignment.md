3. There seems to be one main contributer, 'robmadole', that does most of the work which might not be beneficial in group projects. There are also many branches that have not been merged for an extended period of time which I think could contribute to some problems in cohesion in the future. There also seems to be less activity now in comparison to the start of the year. This could either be due to there being less to add to the project as of now which is fine, or due to a lack of consistency which does not bode well for the future of the project. For my future projects I am going to try to distribute a consistent workload.
